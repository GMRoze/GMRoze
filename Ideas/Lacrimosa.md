# Lacrimosa
## Or the last days of Humanity

When humanity first launched itself in space, there was some fear about the things we could find or discover - there was, however, no  fear about the things we never found. And for the remaining centuries, the crippling loneliness of space vacuum was humanity's only company.

Humans, as always, adapted to it. In the few worlds and space stations scattered, people learned to patiently wait for the slow and infrequent radio messages broadcasted throught the great nothing. And whenever they arrived, they often contained a few technical words detailing how another research station was being shut down due to lack of further interest in that space system.

Sounds became quieter, and the long dark between stars streched everyday. People now often wondered how the many decades of travelling could ever bother the oh-so-impatient people of past centuries. They often wondered (and disbelieved) that the world was once a crowded place, where people would fight (fight, ah! imagine the concept!) for land. For them,  the loneliness was as natural as the dark and distance of space.

It was not all bad. Housing was a problem no more, as few people had neighbors. Entire housing blocks were sometimes occupied by 1 or 2 families - who by choice, often lived in opposite ends and only said passing words to each other. Traffic had also became a problem as fewer and fewer people walked the sprawling roads and crosswalks of cities.

Minsk-3, the great administrative capital of the Comissariat of Earth, once had its inhabitants by thousands. Now they were counted in the hundreds. Only one hospital in the district had kept its maternity yard remained open, and in most days the cribs were empty and its staff wandered the empty corridors aimlessly. In the past, philosophy centered around asking why we were bought into this world. Now, it seemed, the question was why even bring someone into it.

The opera house, who was once crowded by the high echelons of government, was a masterpiece of sound design - and yet, little use was there, since it was harder and harder to fill even a tenth of its seats. Even its sound isolation had become useless as the melancholic notes of  Lacrimosa could be heard by the empty streets. The orchestra and choir of Minsk-3 were the few in the continental Eurasia that had no vaccant seats, and they often only met when the Comissar-General came by. He often sat some 7 rows behind, tucked in his coat. He had deemed heathing the building a non-priority, presentations were empty and short. His favorite one was the opera that started with: "'Were the humans real?', 'No. Just a myth."

Many centuries ago, a young girl, exasperated by some new conaissances in physics, desperately warned her father that humans were floating aimlessly in space, and earth was but a grain of sand in the great nothing of space. Her father answered: "yes, what of it?".

This story is not of that girl. What became of her no one seemed to remember. But it is of an equally nosy young woman, her unquenchable thirst for space, and the last days of humanity on this floating ball we used to call home.
