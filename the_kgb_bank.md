# The KGB Bank

<!-- Inspired by the John Christmas' story and [KGB Banker](https://www.amazon.com/KGB-Banker-William-Burton-McCormick-ebook/dp/B09GTBX6ZQ), but in less international-spy thriller and more in a geopolitics corruption thriler -->

The year is 202x. The COVID pandemic continues to assolate Eastern Europe and the Afeghanistan War has recently ended with the last NATO Soldiers leaving the ground. Former Sargeant and Afghanistan Veteran Jahnis Kraule returns home to Latvia to find a mostly broken life. He struggles with depression, his soon-to-be divorced wife and has a rocky relationship with his father, a veteran of the Soviet Afghan War.

Jahnis takes a governmental job as a bank regulator for the local European Bank for Development. He notices to realize however many inconsistent or undocumented transactions, and begins to uncover a governmental-bank fraud.

In this conspiracy, Kraule realizes not only is the bank related to the Russian Mafia and the former KGB in smuggling narcotics in St. Petersburg, human trafficking in Belarus, but has also started transporting weapons from the Russian-separatist forces in Ukraine to Eastern Latvia.

The time is set, as society slowly prepares to what seems a shadow war between corrupt government officials, malicious russian agents of the FSB and their rebels, extremists latvian right-wingers and the few remaining people loyal to democracy. He also uncovers secrets such as the _Vilkacis Initiative_ and _Sektors V_.

<!-- Also, he dies midway throught, I guess -->
