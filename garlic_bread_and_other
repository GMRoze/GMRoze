# Garlic Bread and Other Recipes to Keep Vampires at Bay

A book by GMR

## Recipe I:

There are two marking characteristics of a vampire: first, they hate crucifixes and second, they like blood. Unfortunately, this makes them not so different from atheists or lovers of rare meat, which is why it is so hard to identify one.

Vampiric nutrition is a field of sciences that has been severely neglected, but still many questions remains on how Vampires feed. It is known they are allergic to garlic, so does it mean they are incapable of eating garlic bread? Has a vampire ever tasted garlic bread? If not, it would perhaps explain their downer sense of humour and morning disposition

Whitout garlic bread, the only source of nutrition of a normal human-like being such as vampires is drinking blood. However, If you ever dependend on liquid to be your main source of nutrition, such as when you eat hospital food, then you know it is not a good life either. Which would explain the vampire's anemic white skin and hatred for sunlight.
Much like an university student.

In fact, a study of vampiric habits shows that modern vampires is undiscernible from your average gamer: usually locked in a dark room, little to no sleep, and unability to look at the mirror. If we combine all of those groups togheter: atheists, loves of raw meat, gamers and university students, it becomes quite clear that in the modern day vampires would prefer dorm rooms than castles. Specially considering the absurd price of real state after the 2008 crisis and Romania's ascension to the EU (and its' byzantine system of laws, some that not even vampires can stand).

On the topic of university dorm rooms being the common vampire habitat, one should also note that the adoption of halloween parties (a somewhat nice change of pace from witch-burning parties, common in the northeastern USA in the 17th century) are another contributing factor to their modern, cozy livelihood. One can guess that vampires are in their absolute prime in said parties.

But, the reader should not grow too fond or have pity for vampires, as they are still vicious creatures. Their elongated life-span (theorically infinite, though most vampires find themselves suffering acute cases of being stabbed in the heart) means that they have no rush to finish university - and consequentilly, like human senior students - pray on young meat, delivered every year with a new batch of college freshmen. So if you find yourself ever faced with a suspected vampire, I have collected a rule-of-thumb emergency tips that have protected me so far in life:
