# 🌲 G.M. Roze

Hello or Bonjour! My name is Gustav Roze and I'm Latvian-Brazilian writer/essayist/articulist (?) based in Lille, France.

In this github I will publish some of the things I'm writing, some projects, some drafts and some ideas.

## A Little Bio
I was born on 1999 at Curitiba, (the best city of) Brazil and spent much of my nostalgic (except for the bullying) childhood in the plains and prairies of the 1st and 2nd Paranaense Plateau 🌾. As a proud southern, I like barbecues, flowers, horse riding, urban planning and the imposing Araucaria woods. 🐴 

My family from my father's side came from Latvian and established themselves in Santa Catarina before moving to Curitiba in the 60's, while on my mother's we can find a mix of sephardic jews, dutch and portuguese settlers from the sunny northeast 🤠 (It might explain the hot-bloodness). 

I'm often torn between these different realities in life, and at this point I think I came to understand them better. My Latvian surename, Roze-Puriņš, reflected that: 🌹 one is imposing and unique, the other is small and common 🌷. 

I've decided to use my middle names for this writing endeavours, not only because it is poetic that you're revealing something from within you with literature (ha!) but also because it separates from my professional and academic work. 🖊️ 

I started writing (seriously) at age 15 for the [Brazilian Association of Latvian Culture](https://letoniabrasil.org/), with my published article about my experiences in Latvia printed on the "Raksti" magazine (A small step for a Latvian, a big step for Latviankind). 👨‍🚀

From 2015-2019 I probably wrote around 50 to 100 of articles mostly about history, culture, tourism and curiosities, some of which are still published on the new website, while others are unfortunately lost forever _~~(thank you, automatic server renewal~~ Now that's a good reason to keep everything on github)._

My biggest victories 🏆 were from 2018: My article "10 things you didn't know about Latvians Brazilian" being republished and quoted in local newspapers, such as in Tupã 📰 and presenting my work to an envoy of the Latvian Ministry of Culture and the  Latvian Embassador for the Diaspora. 🏛️

In any case, since then I had more story ideas than my head could fit, I decided to write them down and bit-by-bit (word-by-word) we will get somewhere somehow.

I've been living in Northern France 🥐🍷 for quite a while now, and have deeply fell in love with the region as well (how many cultures can one person fall in love with?). The Flemish mixture of French names and Dutch surnames, and where the Huguenots meet Europe's rust belt ⛪🏭.

Anyway, that's probably enough about me. What about you?
