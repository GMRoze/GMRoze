# 1934

(Dvorak's New World Symphony)

The year is 1934 and Brazil is at the brink of civil war. São Paulo had started to industrialize after a successful tenentist revolt in 1924 and was the only Brazilian state to survive economically the Big Depression. Varga's government and coalition still came to power but he was assassinated instead of João Pessoa in 1931, leaving the Brazilian government with a poor legitimacy and purpouse other than helping the big landowners.

Now, the old aristocratic classes of São Paulo are faced with increasingly radical homo novi in politics, bringing radical ideas of facism from abroad. A string of events put in place what will be the start of gruelling fighting in the streets up until a trench warfare in the Mantiqueira range and manouever warfare in Paraná.

The protagonist is a banal public servant caught in the middle of conspiracies, while his sociopathic daughter starts to mingle with socialist revolutionaries.
